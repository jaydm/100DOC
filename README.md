# 100DOC
Thought it might make it easier to keep track of #100DaysOfCode

I started on February 22, 2019 and created this repository on March 15th. In that time, I was able to 'put in my time' on 15 of the past 21 days.

As of 2019-03-15: Missed 6 days...Recommitting to at least read/research for an hour each day

This repo will end up as a mish-mosh of bits of code as I work through the rest of the 100 days.

PaLM rework - PaLM is a full stack J2EE application with a MySQL back end database and highly dynamically rendered JavaScript front end driven by data. Originally built using the Dojo library. The primary focus of the rework will be to re-implement the project (and generic specification) management. In this context - a project is closer the physical manufacturing specification rather than a time/process/resource endeavor. Although if this is built properly it should be possible to extend it relatively easily to be able to manage this other 'project
management'.
