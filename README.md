# 100DOC
Thought it might make it easier to keep track of #100DaysOfCode

I started on February 22, 2019 and created this repository on March 15th. In that time, I was able to 'put in my time' on 15 of the past 21 days.

As of 2019-03-15: Missed 6 days...Recommitting to at least read/research for an hour each day
